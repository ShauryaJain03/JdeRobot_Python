## JdeRobot GSoC 2025
This repository has the Python code for a simulation that visualizes Brownian motion by modeling a robot (particle) moving randomly within a confined arena, using Python Standard Library and Numpy, Matplotlib for visualization as a part of JdeRobot's GSoC 2025 Python Test.

### Features
- Real-time visualization of Brownian motion using matplotlib
- Configurable arena size and particle speed
- Physics-based model of particle movement and collision
- Interactive animation of the particle's trajectory

### Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- NumPy
- Matplotlib

### Code Structure

- main.py: Contains the visualization setup and simulation loop
- robot.py: Defines the Robot class that models particle movement
- arena.py: Implements the Arena class for boundary detection

### Setup

1. Clone this repository:
   ```sh
   git clone git@github.com:ShauryaJain03/JdeRobot_Python.git
   cd JdeRobot_Python
   ```
   
2. Install dependencies
   ```sh
   pip install numpy matplotlib
   ```

### Usage

Run the simulation

   ```sh
   python3 simulate.py
   ```
### Demo
